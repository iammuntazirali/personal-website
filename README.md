## Overview

A work-in-progress personal website designed to showcase my projects, skills, and ideas. Right now, it’s mostly a skeleton, but exciting features are on the way!


## 💬 Learning in Public 

I'm building this site as I learn, and your feedback is gold! If you have suggestions, ideas, or improvements — whether about code, design, accessibility or usability — don’t hesitate to share them. Every bit of feedback helps me improve and grow. 
You can also leave feedback directly via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/a-mamal/personal-website/issues).

### 🤝 For Fellow Learners
I'll make sure to be adding **good first issues** for others beginning their journey.
We all need a safe place to start with something, and I would love for this personal project to make room for that.
Exploration, suggestions, and discussion are always welcome.
Feel free to take your time with these issues. 
I hope they help build confidence to tackle something bigger next!
